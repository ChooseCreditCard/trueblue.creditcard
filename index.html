    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Makes a TrueBlue Credit Card Special</h2>
      <p>TrueBlue credit cards link purchases to an airline loyalty balance — not generic cashback. Every eligible transaction earns points in the TrueBlue program, which can be redeemed for flights, upgrades, or partner-service discounts.</p>
      <p>Because the program is airline-centric, the value of points, award seat availability, and partner airline alliances all matter more than with generic rewards or cashback cards. That means you get airline-style perks — if you travel often enough.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Earning -->
    <section id="earn" class="section">
      <h2>How Spending and Flights Earn TrueBlue Points</h2>
      <p>Most card spending earns a base rate of points, often with elevated multipliers for airline purchases, travel-related expenses, or certain partner categories such as hotels or dining. Some offers come with sign-up bonuses or spend-based bonus thresholds for new cardholders.</p>
      <p>When you actually fly with a partner airline under TrueBlue, you may also earn additional points or status credits — combining real flights with everyday spending to build loyalty faster.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Redemption & Value -->
    <section id="redeem" class="section">
      <h2>Redeeming TrueBlue Points: Flights, Upgrades & Flexibility</h2>
      <p>Points can be redeemed for flights, cabin upgrades, or discounts on cash fares depending on the airline’s award chart and seat availability. Redemption cost depends on route, seat class, seasonality and demand — often making premium-class or long-haul flights the best value per point.</p>
      <p>Before redeeming, always compare total cost including taxes, fees and surcharges with cash ticket prices; sometimes “free” flights still come with considerable out-of-pocket costs.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>When a TrueBlue Card Makes Sense — and When It Doesn’t</h2>
      <p>If you travel often — especially on airlines participating in TrueBlue — and are willing to track award availability, a points-based card can yield good value. Frequent flyers and travelers with flexible schedules tend to extract the most benefit.</p>
      <p>On the other hand: if you travel rarely or mostly domestically (and not via program airlines), the accumulation and redemption might not justify the effort. For occasional use, a low-fee cashback or flexible rewards card may be more practical.</p>
